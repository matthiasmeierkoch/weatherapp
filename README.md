# WeatherApp

### About
In this projct I built a weather app with the [P5js](https://p5js.org/) libary. This Projct was part of the «Design and Modules» course by Hanna Züllig.

### The Weather App:
My weatherapp shows the min and max. temperature of today, the sunrise and sunset time such as the rain precipitation.
With the input field you can choose your location and with «Go!» you'll get the weathere informations back.
All weather informations are shown in a circles. The cirle showing the temerature is either more red or more blue, depending ont the temperature, red means warm and blue means cold. The temperature differeence of the day is shown with the distance beetween the circle showing the max and the min temperature.
